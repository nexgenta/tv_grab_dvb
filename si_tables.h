 *    ETSI ISO/IEC 13818-1 specifies SI which is referred to as PSI. The PSI

 *    within the multiplex. The PSI data is structured as four types of table.
 *    The tables are transmitted in sections.
 *
 *    1) Program Association Table (PAT):
 *
 *       - for each service in the multiplex, the PAT indicates the location
 *         (the Packet Identifier (PID) values of the Transport Stream (TS)
 *         packets) of the corresponding Program Map Table (PMT).
 *         It also gives the location of the Network Information Table (NIT).
